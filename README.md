## Welcome to Finetize v1.2! 

**Changes made to v1.1:**

* **Analysis:**
    * HUGE data improvements. Now the plot will be precise down to each trading day (some price data was missing before, leading to inaccurate simulation and symbol analysis).
    * Further improved price plots navigation and visualization. 
* **Simulation:**
    * Added an Auto button to select the lookback days with the greatest return.
    * Added a baseline model: Buy and Hold, for a more intuitive comparison
    * Added real world Assumptions (Taxes, Fees, Delays) for a more realistic simulation.
* **[NEW!] Test:**
    * Added for strategy comparison against, well, the entire market!
    * See which symbol the strategy worked best against, and which it lost the most!

*Some minor changes to the UI and Navigation system.
